## Requirements

JupyterLite is being tested against modern web browsers:

- Firefox 90+
- Chromium 89+

## Getting Data

The Virtual Platform is capable of doing federated queries/analytics over multiple partners. It then writes the output to a web-accesible filestore for you to retrieve.

The VP will give you a "secret key" that leads to the output from your federated execution. If you enter that secret key into the "XXX" near the beginning of the Jupyter Notebook,
you will be able to import your data into the analytical environment and begin your study.

Have fun!
